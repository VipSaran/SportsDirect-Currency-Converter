# SportsDirect.com Currency Converter

Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey UserScript for displaying prices in currency not supported originally.


## Prerequisites

To be able to employ the UserScript, your browser needs to have corresponding extensions installed:

 - Chrome: [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
 - Firefox: [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)


## Installation

Once your browser is equipped with appropriate extension, simply open [this link](https://github.com/VipSaran/SportsDirect-Currency-Converter/raw/master/sportsdirect-currency-converter.user.js). The extension should recognize the script and offer you to install it.

## Usage

The script automatically detects the selected currency and uses it for conversions. The conversion rate (per currency) is loaded once per day and is cached until next day.

## Limitations

 - displays only values in HRK
